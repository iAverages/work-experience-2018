# work-experience-2018
Python scripts that I made while at work experience in 2018.

These scripts are some of the first scripts I made with python (Outside of school). Both scripts were used by the company in production, one to clear .ini files from their studnet file backups and one to move photos that are older than 2 days old (Not including weekend days) to a backup location.
